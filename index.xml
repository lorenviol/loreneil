        <description>&lt;img src="https://example.com/our-story/first.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Our Story" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorenzo‚Äôs and Neil‚Äôs story is something of both special and incredible ..
They were both strangers living their own life on the opposite sides of this planet, and on a particular day everything changed for the better in an unpredictable way.
It all started with a like by Lorenzo on an Instagram photo captured and posted by Neil on a sunny day in his Manila&amp;rsquo;s neighbourhood, edited using the Filmborn app; from there they started exchanging messages, became best buds for life and eventually fell in Love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they texted, FaceTimed and planned their first heavenly trip as a couple to: Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand; but for some diabolical forces beyond their control it couldn‚Äôt go through.
So Lorenzo moved to the UK and Neil back in his hometown, both looking for a job that could make the dream of ending their long distance chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year later they finally both made it happen to complete the best trip ever done on Earth as a couple. They traveled north and south the Philippines together, met Neil&amp;rsquo;s family, creating the best memories they ever had, sharing and caring the Love they have for each other. After traveling many places in Asia together, such as: Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Macao; they wanted to visit Europe with Lorenzo&amp;rsquo;s family as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the first Italian VISA rejection Lorenzo traveled back to Neil in the Philippines with a promise: to never leave each other up until a positive result would come. Another rejection and many many problems came their way, but those didn&amp;rsquo;t let them down. After two years leaving together in the Philippines their wish came true, the VISA was finally approved!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, another wonderful chapter of their life is about to happen, wishing that you could join them in their new beginning&amp;hellip;

&lt;p&gt;We cherished this moment having our family together and close to us, especially since it was on our last days in the Philippines.
